# liu-master-planner

Helps students choose courses for their master at Linköping University.

## Purpose

Students at Linköping University need to choose their master profile in year 3 before the master.
Often the program has multiple profiles and you can only choose one, but you can choose some courses from other profiles.
That makes the choice difficult because there are many requirements for a master degree.
This project will first be optimized for *D-sektionen*, but will expand to other programs on Faculty of Science and Engineering.
